The number of mice is 249

Removing the duplicate mouse (g989)

The number of mice is 248


Capomulin appears to be the drug with the greatest ammount of timepoints at roughly 280
followed by Ramicane 270 ish.


The amount of timepoints is valuable as it increases the resolution and value of the observations and analysis.


The realtionship of Male to Female mice is roughly equal 1:1, this is a good way to determine if sex is a modifier of outcomes.
The weight of the modifier is roughly equal in this case.

Box Plots (4 Drugs)
Considering only 4 drugs. Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin.
It appears the most effective is Ramicane with a mean tumor volume of 36 mm3
followed by Capomulin at 38 mm3


F966

I followed the tumor values of Mouse F966 which uses Capomulin.
As we may recal, Capomulin is the most effective drug.
The results shows a final value of 33 mm3 compared to a starting value of 45 mm3.
The time delta between the start and end of the trial for this mouse is 45 days.
It appears the treatment has been significantly successfull in reducing tumor volume.

There is however a peculiar trend that could be significant, the tumor appears to grow slighly at diferent poitns during the trial.
Before dropping off in two instances, at the end of the trial we can also see there could be a third reapearance of this trend.



Linear Regression 


There apears to be a direct relationship between the weight of the mouse and the Tumor volume.
y = 1.75x + 1.45

This finding is not particularly surprising as the weight of the mouse is also directly related to its overall volume.
